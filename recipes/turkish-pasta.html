    <p><h2>Ingredients (For 2)</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>250g Ground Beef or Lamb</li>
        <li>180g Farfalle Pasta</li>
        <li>100g Greek Yoghurt</li>
        <li>3 Cloves of Garlic</li>
        <li>50g Butter</li>
        <li>Pink Himayalan Salt</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Lemon</li>
        <li>Red Pepper Flakes</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h2>Method</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Save half a cup of the cooking liquid, drain the pasta, and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Saute meat: While the pasta is cooking, add the ground meat in a large skillet (or a pan) and cook until the meat is no longer pink.</li>
        <li>Make the garlicky yogurt sauce: Mix yogurt, minced garlic, lemon juice and pink himayalan salt in a bowl until super creamy. Taste for seasoning and make sure it is seasoned according to your taste buds.</li>
        <li>Make the butter drizzle: I recommend making the butter drizzle right before serving. The process is super simple. Melt butter in a small saucepan and then stir in 1 teaspoon paprika, ¼ teaspoon (or more) red pepper flakes and ½ teaspoon pink himayalan salt. Cook until butter is fully melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Assemble: To serve, grab a pasta bowl. Place the cooked pasta at the bottom, spoon 4 tablespoons of the yogurt sauce on top followed by ½ of the cooked meat. Finish it with a drizzle (about one or two tablespoons) of the paprika butter sauce. Repeat same proces for other bowl.</li>
        <li>Garnish: Sprinkle the parsley over the top. </li>
    </ol>
